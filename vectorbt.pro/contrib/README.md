This folder contains various useful things contributed by the community around the software.

To contribute, fork the repository, make changes to this folder, and [submit a PR](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt.pro/pulls).

Please make sure to use a [consistent file/folder naming schema](https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/inc_public/Pages/folder-file-names.aspx).
As a rule of thumb, use the pascal case for notebooks (such as "ChartPatternDetection.ipynb") and the snake case for everything related 
to Python (such as "tradingview_parser/main.py"). Files with other extensions can also include hyphens (such as "gdp-data.json").

Please also make sure to use [Python's style recommendations](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python).

This folder has a separate license - [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) - allowing its (and only its!) contents to be open-sourced.
If you want to restrict that, create a subfolder and a separate "LICENSE.md" file inside.
